## Overview

The Flat Loop Universe proposes that our universe has a toroidal topology - it is flat yet finite, looping back on itself in all three dimensions. This model addresses several cosmological puzzles while providing a framework for understanding emergence, perception, and the nature of time.

Key concepts:
- **Topologically Closed, Geometrically Flat** — A 3-torus structure allows finite spatial extent without curvature
- **Recursive Structure** — Symbolic patterns loop through time and space, forming attractors
- **Emergent Time** — Time emerges from recursive transitions rather than existing as an external parameter
- **Finite Substrate, Infinite Depth** — Complexity arises through symbolic self-reference
- **Agent-Based Cognition** — Observation modeled as symbolic interaction between embedded agents and substrate

## FIRMAMENT Simulation

FIRMAMENT is a symbolic recursive substrate that demonstrates how symbolic agents can simulate infinite logic within finite toroidal space. The simulation shows:

- **Toroidal Space**: Implemented through modular arithmetic to create wrapped boundaries
- **Symbolic Computation**: Discrete symbols form patterns based on local interaction rules
- **Agent-Based Perception**: Agents with memory and adaptive behavior that respond to their environment
- **Recursive Nested Universes**: Each agent contains an inner grid - a universe within a universe
- **Emergent Patterns**: Complex structures that arise from simple rules and interactions

### Visualization Example

The simulation produces visualizations of the symbolic substrate, showing how patterns evolve over time and how agents interact with their environment.

## Paper Abstract

We propose the Flat Loop Universe (FLU), a novel cosmological theory that synthesizes geometric flatness, closed spatial topology, symbolic recursion, and computational emergence. While the standard cosmological model treats a flat universe as infinite, the FLU instead models the universe as a finite but unbounded toroidal structure—one where space loops onto itself without curvature. This topology supports a range of unexplained phenomena, from cosmic microwave background (CMB) anomalies to the illusion of infinite depth. Combined with symbolic physics and recursive simulation engines such as FIRMAMENT, we argue that the Flat Loop Universe provides a compelling unified framework for cosmology, quantum gravity, and the emergence of perception and intelligence.
